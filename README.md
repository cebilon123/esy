# WAFFLE

## Introduction
Probably you know about CloudFlare, every one knows, but this is a partially paid solution. As the open source community
we are missing a real modular and open source **Web Application Firewall** that could be used in the place of CF.

## How to run / Develop ?

### Prerequisites 
+ Go 1.22
+ make (if windows, try using chocolatey)
+ openssl (if windows, try using git bash)

### Generate certificates
Execute make certs_windows and go through process. It should certs in the .cert directory.

## Planned features / Architecture
To bo honest, I'm learning how to write WAF from the scratch, so this part will be updated after a while.
